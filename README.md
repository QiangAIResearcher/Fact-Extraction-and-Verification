# Fact-Extraction-and-Verification

This is the repository for the task of Fact Extraction and Verification described in the NAACL2018 paper: : [FEVER: A large-scale dataset for Fact Extraction and VERification.]()

>Unlike other tasks and despite recent interest, research in textual claim verification has been hindered by the lack of large-scale manually annotated datasets. In this paper we introduce a new publicly available dataset for verification against textual sources, FEVER: Fact Extraction and VERification. It consists of 185,441 claims generated by altering sentences extracted from Wikipedia and subsequently verified without knowledge of the sentence they were derived from. The claims are classified as Supported, Refuted or NotEnoughInfo by annotators achieving 0.6841 in Fleiss Îº. For the first two classes, the annotators also recorded the sentence(s) forming the necessary evidence for their judgment. 

### Baseline

The baseline model constists of two Logistic Regression models for document retrieval and sentence selection respectively.
